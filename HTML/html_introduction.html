<!--Introduction to HTML-->


<!--1. In the code editor to the right, type your name in between <h1> and </h1>, then press Run.-->

<h1>Sal Castaneda</h1>



<!--The Body-->

<!--
    1.Add a body to your web page using the <body> element.
    2.Add the following code between your opening and closing body tags:

<p>"Life is very short and what we have to do must be done in the now." - Audre Lorde</p>
Note: While some browsers may render some content outside body tags as well to accommodate the occasional mistake in your HTML, not all browsers do this! The best way to ensure that all your HTML renders the same way in all browsers is to ensure that your elements remain within the opening and closing body tags.
-->

<body>
    <p>"Life is very short and what we have to do must be done in the now."
      - Audre Lorde
    </p>
</body>



<!--HTML Structure-->

<!--1. Add the paragraph below as a child of the div element.

<p>This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element</p>-->


<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  
    <div>
     
        <p>This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element
        </p>
  
    </div>  

</body>



<!--Headings-->


<!--
    1.Now that you know how to structure HTML elements, we’ll spend the rest of the lesson building an informational website using some of the most common HTML elements. We’ve put some elements in to get you started, but you’ll write the rest of the page on your own.

    Below the <h3> heading that says Features, add an <h2> heading that says Habitat.

    2.Below the Habitat heading, add an <h3> heading that says Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations.

    3.On the next line, add one more <h3> heading that says Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations.

    4.Finally, on the next line add an <h2> heading that says Media.
-->


<body>
    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
    <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
    <h3>Species</h3>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <h3>Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations</h3>
    <h3>Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations</h3>
    <h2>Media</h2>
</body>



<!--Divs-->


<!--
    1.Below the <h1> heading that says The Brown Bear, add an opening <div> tag.

    Place the closing </div> tag after the <h3> element that says Features.

    Remember to use your space bar to add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements.

    2.Above the <h2> element that says Habitat, add an opening <div> tag.

    Close the </div> tag after the <h3> element that says Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations.

    3.Above the <h2> element that says Media, add an opening <div> tag.

    Place the closing </div> tag right above the closing </body> tag.
-->


<body>
    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
      <h3>Species</h3>
      <h3>Features</h3>

    </div> 
  
    <div>
      <h2>Media</h2>
    </div> 
    
</body>



<!--Attributes-->


<!--
    1.Add an id attribute with the value "introduction" to the <div> tag that’s below the The Brown Bear <h1> heading.

    2.Add an id attribute with the value "habitat" to the opening <div> tag that has the Habitat <h2> heading as a child.

    3.Add an id attribute with the value "media" to the opening <div> tag that has the Media <h2> heading as a child.
-->


<body>
    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
    <div id="introduction">
      <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>

<!--Dispalying Text-->

<!--
    1.Below the <h2> element that says About Brown Bears, add <p> opening and closing tags, and inside of the tags put the following text:

    “The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is native to parts of northern Eurasia and North America. Its conservation status is currently Least Concern. There are many subspecies within the brown bear species, including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.”

    Remember to always add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements inside of <div>s for better readability.

    2.Below the <h3> element that says Features, add a paragraph with the following text:

    “Brown bears are not always completely brown. Some can be reddish or yellowish. They have very large, curved claws and huge paws. Male brown bears are often 30% larger than female brown bears. They can range from 5 feet to 9 feet from head to toe.”

    3.Under the <h3> element that says:

    Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations

    Add a paragraph with the following text:

    “Some countries with smaller brown bear populations include Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Finland, France, Greece, India, Japan, Nepal, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.”
